# PepScaf

This repository contains the implementation code for paper [PepScaf: Harnessing Machine Learning with *In Vitro* Selection toward *De Novo* Macrocyclic Peptides against IL-17C/IL-17RE Interaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.3c00627).

In this study, we first conducted the in vitro selection of macrocyclic peptides against interleukin-17C (IL-17C) using a primary library (17C-Lib1), which gave us a macrocyclic peptide ligand capable of inhibiting IL-17C/IL-17RE interaction with the $IC_{50}$ value at *166* nM. To further improve the activity, we built a framework termed PepScaf to generate the critical scaffold relative to the bioactivity on the basis of the vast dataset generated from the 4th round of 17C-Lib1. Based on the generated scaffold, a focus library (17C-Lib2) was constructed and applied in a macrocyclic peptide selection against IL-17C again. This afforded us with *20* biologically active macrocyclic peptides against IL-17C/IL-17RE interaction with $IC_{50}$ values below *10* nM, of which the best two macrocyclic peptides exhibited their notable inhibitory activities with both IC50 values at *1.4* nM.

## Installation

The code was test on `GPU 3060` with

- `python=3.8`
- `pytorch==1.12.1`
- `cudatoolkit=11.3`

### Conda

We use `conda` to install the dependencies for PepScaf from the provided `environment.yml` file, which can give you the exact python environment we run the code for the paper:

> **NOTE**: we [also](https://github.com/mattragoza/liGAN) highly recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of vanilla conda for managing your conda environments. Mamba is a drop-in replacement for conda that is:

- Faster at solving environments (>10x in my experience)
- Better at resolving conflicts
- More informative when something goes wrong.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hongliangduan/PepScaf.git
cd PepScaf
mamba env create -f environment.yml
pip install sci-ztools==0.1.0

mamba activate pepscaf
```

## Usage

### Preprocess

```bash
python bin/preprocessing.py  # preprocessing for raw data
python bin/cluster.py  # get cluster to get targets
```

### Train and Evaluation

```bash
bash train.sh
bash eval.sh
```

### Analysis and Gneration

```bash
bash get_attn.sh
```

Run `notebooks/Score.ipynb` to get position scores.

```bash
bash mcts.sh  # run mcts to get the scaffold
```
